 * Discriminator Object
 *
 * https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.0.md#discriminatorObject
 * When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a discriminator object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation. The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the specification of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.
 * When using the discriminator, inline schemas will not be considered.
 * 
 * Example: 
 * In scenarios where the value of the discriminator field does not match the schema name or implicit mapping is not possible, an optional mapping definition MAY be used:

    MyResponseType:
    oneOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'
    - $ref: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'
    discriminator:
        propertyName: pet_type
        mapping:
        dog: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
        monster: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'
    Here the discriminator value of dog will map to the schema #/components/schemas/Dog, rather than the default (implicit) value of Dog. If the discriminator value does not match an implicit or explicit mapping, no schema can be determined and validation SHOULD fail. Mapping keys MUST be string values, but tooling MAY convert response values to strings for comparison.

    When used in conjunction with the anyOf construct, the use of the discriminator can avoid ambiguity where multiple schemas may satisfy a single payload.

    In both the oneOf and anyOf use cases, all possible schemas MUST be listed explicitly. To avoid redundancy, the discriminator MAY be added to a parent schema definition, and all schemas comprising the parent schema in an allOf construct may be used as an alternate schema.

query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.

The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.
